Configuration file '/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.

If this is a new install then Y else just press enter to continue unless you want the updated cfg file.

# Installation for the first time
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
	# use defaults

For testing, I comment out the bind address, for production you will want to keep the bind address and/or add more, 
	this limit possible connection to the DB server so even if someon was to be able to get on the network, they 
	would still need to use the bind IP
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf 
	#comment out bind-address
	# to find it 
	<ctrl>w
	bind-address<enter>
	# Note - as of version 10.11, you can specify more than one bind address, comma-separated
	#save
	<ctrl>x
	Y
	#it will display file name to write
	<enter>
